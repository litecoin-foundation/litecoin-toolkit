# Litecoin Toolkit

A web-based collection of cryptography tools for schemes/algorithms used in
[Litecoin](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin) and [LNDltc](https://github.com/ltcsuite/lnd).

**This toolkit has been built with educational purposes in mind!**  
It is meant to play around with different schemes and algorithms to understand how they work.  
However, you must be **extremely careful** when using real/live/mainnet data/keys/credentials!  
A web browser usually is not a safe environment to either create strong cryptographic keys and/or
paste sensitive information into. So consider yourself warned.
